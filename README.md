Game: Apple Apocalypse
Description: My game is a single-player apple catching game.
In the simulation, a player’s avatar is located at the bottom of the screen and can 
only move left and right using the arrow keys. At the top of the screen, apples, bananas, and 
cherries will fall from the sky, beginning at random locations and falling in a random order. 
The player must catch the apples and avoid the cherries and bananas. If the player catches a banana or 
cherry, then they lose the game. At the bottom right of the screen is a score counter that keeps track
of how many apples the player has caught. As the player’s score increases, the fruit will begin to fall 
faster from the top of the screen, making the game progressively harder as time passes. The game ends once 
the player has caught a fruit besides an apple, and a game over screen will appear. On this screen will also 
be the player’s final score. Also, when it comes to catching the fruit, there is no key that the player must 
press in order to do. Making contact with the fruit in any will result as a catch.

How to Play:
 Use the arrow keys to move left and right

Special Features:
Fruit falls faster as game goes on
Game over screen appears when player loses
